## Smart Irrigation System using Arduino Uno
This repository contains the code and instructions for a Smart Irrigation System using an Arduino Uno. The system is designed to automate watering plants based on real-time soil moisture levels, improving water efficiency and reducing manual labor. It uses an LCD to display system status and a relay to control a water pump.

## Features
Soil Moisture Monitoring: Measures soil moisture percentage using a sensor connected to the Arduino's analog input.
- Automated Pump Control: Activates or deactivates the water pump based on soil moisture levels.
- User-Friendly LCD Display: Shows real-time soil moisture percentage and pump status (ON/OFF).
- Three Moisture Levels: Displays moisture conditions (LOW, MID, HIGH) for better clarity.
- Efficient Water Usage: Water pump operates only when necessary, saving water and energy.
